Khan's Algorithm
 
1) Requirement - queue , indegree array ( Number of incoming edges to a node)

2)	Algorithm - 

1) Insert all the nodes with indegree ==  0 into queue data structure
2)traverse into queue and to the neighbour and subtract 1 from the indegree array
3) If the indegree of any node is 0 then put it into queue 

Note - if indegree of any node is == 0 it means that we can put into our answer array
